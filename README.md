### 1 - Lines   
Using the equation of a straight line y = ax + b, write a program for drawing lines. The end of the line should be chosen by the mouse. 

### 2 - Drawing circles and ellipses
1. Using the equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2, write a program for drawing circles. Center point and radius of circle should be chosen by the mouse.
2. By using parametric equation:   
{ x = a * cos(t)   
{ y = b * sin(t)   
write a program for drawing polygons, where vertices of polygon are lying on the ellipse set by the above equation. Center point and axes of the ellipse should be chosen by the mouse.
   
### 3 - Bezier Curves
Write a program for drawing bezier curves of order 3 constructed from few connected segments. Program should allow adding and moving control points.
   
### 4 - B-Spline
Write a program for drawing B-Spline curves of order 3 (homogeneous). Program should allow adding and moving control points.
   
### 5 - Flood Fill    
Write a program for filling polygons (and others figures) with specified color by using Flood Fill technique.
   
### 6 - Color Models   
Write a program that represents two color models - RGB and HSV.
   
### 7 - Blend Modes   
Write a program presenting at least 5 selected blending modes.
    
### 8 - Morphological Operations   
Write a program presenting the action of the 4 basic morphological operations (erosion, dilation, opening, closing) on binary image.
