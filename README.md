# Graphics and multimedia laboratory
My own solutions to the exercises of graphics and multimedia laboratory course (studies).

### 1 - Lines   
Using the equation of a straight line y = ax + b, write a program for drawing lines. The end of the line should be chosen by the mouse. 

### 2 - Drawing circles and ellipses
1. Using the equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2, write a program for drawing circles. Center point and radius of circle should be chosen by the mouse.
2. By using parametric equation:   
{ x = a * cos(t)   
{ y = b * sin(t)   
write a program for drawing polygons, where vertices of polygon are lying on the ellipse set by the above equation. Center point and axes of the ellipse should be chosen by the mouse.
